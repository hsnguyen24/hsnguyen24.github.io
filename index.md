## About

I'm Sean, an M.S. student at Oregon State University working as a graduate research assistant with [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). My current research focuses on principled methods for unsupervised deep learning with provable guarantees on identifiability and robustness. I received my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in March 2024, working with [Prof. Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai). Outside of work, my hobbies are writing, cooking, and photography.

## Keywords
