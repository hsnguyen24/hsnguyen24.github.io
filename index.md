## About

I'm an incoming M.S. student at Oregon State University, advised by [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). I received my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence (with first-class honours) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in March 2024, working with [Prof. Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai). My current research focuses on principled methods for unsupervised deep learning, with provable guarantees on identifiability, robustness, and sample complexity. I'm also interested in matrix factorization and graph signal processing. Outside of work, my hobbies are writing and cooking.

- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models, matrix factorization
- **Signal Processing:** graph learning from network signals
