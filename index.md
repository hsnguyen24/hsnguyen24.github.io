## About

I'm Sean, a M.S. student at Oregon State University working as a graduate research assistant with [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). My current research focuses on principled methods for matrix factorization and unsupervised deep learning, with provable guarantees on identifiability and robustness. I received my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence (with first-class honours) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in March 2024, working with [Prof. Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai) on graph signal processing. Outside of work, my hobbies are writing, cooking, and photography. 

## News
- **[September 2024]** I gave a talk on low-pass graph signal processing at [Faculty of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, National Economics University](https://fda.neu.edu.vn/) in Hanoi, Vietnam; the slides are available [here](./assets/files/Talk_at_NEU_2024.pdf) (many thanks to Prof. Wai for presentation materials).
- **[July 2024]** Our work on low-pass graph signal detection under partial observations was awarded [Best Student Paper Award at IEEE SAM 2024](./assets/img/sam2024_award.jpg)!
