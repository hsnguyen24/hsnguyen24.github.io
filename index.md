## About

I'm Sean, a second-year M.S. student at Oregon State University working with [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). My current research focuses on representation learning and self-supervised learning guided by principles of identifiability and robustness, with applications in domain translation and multimodal learning. I received my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in March 2024, working with [Prof. Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai) on robust graph signal processing and graph learning methods.

Outside of work, my hobbies are cooking and photographing my friends whenever I can.

Feel free to ping me an email for a coffee chat, work-related or not!

## Research Interests
representation learning, self-supervised learning, graph learning, graph signal processing, matrix factorization, domain translation, multimodal learning

## News
- **[Sep. 2025]** Diverse influence component analysis is accepted at NeuRIPS 2025. We proposed a new approach to the hard problem of nonlinear mixture learning, via Jacobian geometry.
- **[Sep. 2025]** A preprint on graph learning is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14887)! We show that graph learning from smooth signals is implicit robust to missing data.
- **[April 2025]** Our contribution on graph learning under partial observation was accepted at the Graph Signal Processing Workshop 2025. The poster is available [here](./assets/files/GSPW2025_Poster.pdf).
- **[September 2024]** I gave a talk on low-pass graph signal processing at [Faculty of Data Science and AI, National Economics University](https://fda.neu.edu.vn/) in Hanoi, Vietnam; the slides are [here](./assets/files/Talk_at_NEU_2024.pdf).
- **[July 2024]** Our work on low-pass graph signal detection under partial observations was awarded Best Student Paper Award at IEEE SAM 2024! A preprint is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10001).
