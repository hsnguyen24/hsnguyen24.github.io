## About

I'm Sean, an M.S. student at Oregon State University working with [Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). My current research focuses on deep representation learning and self-supervised learning, with applications in multimodal learning, generative modeling, and interpretability. I received my B.Eng. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (First Class Honours) in 2024, working with [Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai) on graph machine learning and graph signal processing.

Outside of work, my hobbies are cooking, falling in love with Asian [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/notseanthesheep/), and photographing my friends whenever I can. Feel free to ping me an email for a coffee chat, work-related or not!

## Research Interests
representation learning, self-supervised learning, graph machine learning, graph signal processing, matrix factorization, domain translation, vision-language model, interpretability

## News
- **[Sep. 2025]** Diverse influence component analysis is accepted at **NeuRIPS 2025**! We proposed a new approach for provably disentangling latent components of data, via Jacobian geometry. We explored some initial applications of the proposed learning principle in single-cell transcriptomics analysis and unsupervised concept discovery in images.
- **[Sep. 2025]** A preprint on graph learning is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14887)! We show that graph topology learning from smooth signals is implicitly robust to missing data. That means we can reliably estimate the subgraph of observed nodes, when the signals are sufficiently smooth (such as in opinion dynamics on social network, or sensor network).
- **[April 2025]** Our contribution on graph learning under partial observation was accepted at the **Graph Signal Processing Workshop 2025**. The poster is available [here](./assets/files/GSPW2025_Poster.pdf).
- **[September 2024]** I gave a talk on low-pass graph signal processing at [Faculty of Data Science and AI, National Economics University](https://fda.neu.edu.vn/) in Hanoi, Vietnam; the slides are [here](./assets/files/Talk_at_NEU_2024.pdf).
- **[July 2024]** Our work on low-pass graph signal detection under partial observations was awarded Best Student Paper Award at **IEEE SAM 2024**! A preprint is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10001). We show that performance of low-pass signal detector is not affected too much by nodes gone missing. That means we can apply these detectors to robustify graph learning methods or identify anomalies in networked systems, even under missing data.
