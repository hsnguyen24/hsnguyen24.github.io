## About

I'm Sean, an M.S. student at Oregon State University working with [Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). My current research focuses on deep representation learning from first principles, with applications in multimodal learning, generative modeling, and interpretability. I received my B.Eng. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (First Class Honours) in 2024, working with [Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai) on graph machine learning and graph signal processing.

Outside of work, my hobbies are cooking, falling in love with Asian [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/notseanthesheep/), and photographing my friends whenever I can. Feel free to ping me an email for a coffee chat, work-related or not!

## Research Interests
deep representation learning, self-supervised learning, graph machine learning, graph signal processing, matrix factorization, domain translation, multimodal learning
