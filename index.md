## About

I'm an incoming M.S. student at Oregon State University, advised by [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia). I received my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence (with first-class honours) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in March 2024, working with [Prof. Hoi-To Wai](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai) on graph signal processing. My current research focuses on principled methods for unsupervised deep learning, with provable guarantees on identifiability, robustness, and sample complexity Outside of work, my hobbies are writing and cooking.

- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models
- **Signal Processing:** graph learning from network data

## News

- **[July 2024]** Our work on low-pass graph signal detection (under partial observations) is awarded Best Student Paper Award at IEEE SAM 2024!
